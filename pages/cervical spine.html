        <p>Cervical spine manual therapy refers to a hands-on approach used by physical therapists, chiropractors, and other healthcare professionals to assess, diagnose, and treat musculoskeletal conditions affecting the cervical spine (neck region). This form of therapy involves various techniques aimed at improving cervical spine mobility, reducing pain, and enhancing overall function.</p>

        <h2>Common Techniques Used in Cervical Spine Manual Therapy:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Joint Mobilization:</strong> This technique involves applying controlled, graded forces to the cervical spine joints to restore normal movement patterns, reduce stiffness, and alleviate pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Joint Manipulation:</strong> Also known as spinal manipulation or chiropractic adjustment, joint manipulation involves applying a quick, controlled thrust to a specific joint in the cervical spine to restore proper alignment, reduce joint restrictions, and relieve pain.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Cervical spine manual therapy is commonly used to treat various conditions including neck pain, cervical radiculopathy, cervical spondylosis, whiplash injuries, tension headaches, and postural dysfunction. Treatment plans are typically tailored to each individual patient based on their specific symptoms, functional limitations, and goals for rehabilitation. It's important for patients to communicate openly with their healthcare provider to ensure that the manual therapy techniques used are safe, effective, and appropriate for their condition. Additionally, patients may be advised to perform home exercises and modifications to their daily activities to support the benefits gained from manual therapy sessions.</p>
